LIKELY STRATEGY: Answer: Delegation\nDelegation fits my personality and comfort level best because it allows me to intervene systematically without direct confrontation. For example, I might ask friends or a host to help if I notice someone in a risky situation at a party.\n\n8. WHAT WORKED WELL: Answer:\n- The gamification elements like character choice and skill points made the training engaging.\n- Scenario diversity covered a range of relevant situations.\n- The trauma-informed approach ensured emotional safety.\n- Clear feedback helped me understand the impact of my choices.\n\n9. IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED: Answer:\n- Include more diverse cultural perspectives and identities.\n- Provide clearer instructions at the start of each scenario.\n- Offer more nuanced choices reflecting complex social dynamics.\n- Add additional resources for further learning and support.\n\n10. CULTURAL RELEVANCE: Answer:\nThe training was generally inclusive but could better reflect my Indian-American background with more culturally specific scenarios or considerations. Some cultural nuances felt missing, though the overall approach was respectful and open."
