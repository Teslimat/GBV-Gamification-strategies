## 4. Recommendations for Step 5 (Refinement)

### High Priority:
- **Maintain current approach**: Metrics meet or exceed all targets
- **Focus on scaling**: Prepare for broader rollout

### Additional Considerations:
- Review qualitative feedback for specific pain points
- Consider A/B testing for scenarios with lower engagement
- Expand character options if diversity feedback indicates gaps

## 5. Success Criteria Assessment

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Completion Rate | ≥70% | 100.0% | ✅ Pass |
| Time Spent | 20-30 min | 23.8 min | ✅ Pass |
| Safety Rating | ≥4.0/5.0 | 4.92/5.0 | ✅ Pass |
| Would Recommend | ≥75% rate 4-5 | 100.0% | ✅ Pass |
